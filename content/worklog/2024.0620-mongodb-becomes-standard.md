## Context

Following the success of the roadside assistance application, the insurance subsidiary initiated a full mobile app rebuild in 2023. The existing app was aging, built on legacy patterns, and couldn't support the product expansion the business wanted. A new cross-functional team was assembled to rebuild from scratch.

## Constraint / Problem

The original roadside assistance project had proven MongoDB worked in a regulated insurance environment, but it was a single use case. Scaling that decision to an entire mobile platform meant convincing enterprise architecture reviewers that a document database could handle policy data, claims workflows, customer profiles, and transactional operations — not just flexible incident records.

The team was also new. Engineers came from different backgrounds with varying levels of MongoDB experience. Standardising on a database meant standardising how the entire team thought about data modelling.

## Action Taken

Used the roadside assistance app as the reference architecture. Demonstrated to the architecture review board how the flexible schema had reduced change requests during production — new incident types, additional provider fields, and regulatory reporting changes all absorbed without migrations.

Built internal documentation covering MongoDB patterns specific to insurance domain objects: policy documents with nested coverage arrays, claims with embedded approval chains, customer profiles with dynamic preference fields. Ran workshops with the new team to establish consistent data modelling conventions before development started.

Chose MongoDB Atlas for managed infrastructure, removing operational burden from the team and addressing the security team's concerns about database administration in a regulated environment.

## Outcome / Result

MongoDB became the standard database for the mobile app rebuild. The architecture review board approved it based on the operational track record from roadside assistance and the documented patterns for insurance-specific data structures.

The team adopted the conventions from the workshops, which reduced code review friction around data modelling decisions. The mobile app shipped its first release in 2024 with policy viewing, claims submission, and roadside assistance integrated into a single platform.

The precedent set here meant subsequent projects in the subsidiary defaulted to MongoDB without requiring a separate architecture review — it had moved from "exception requiring justification" to "standard choice."
