## Context

Needed a personal site to document work — not a portfolio, not a blog, not a marketing site. A structured work log that captures context, constraints, actions, and outcomes from shipping software in enterprise environments.

## Constraint / Problem

Most Hugo themes and site templates are oriented toward blogs, portfolios, or consultant marketing. The content model needed to enforce a specific structure (Context, Constraint, Action, Outcome) rather than free-form prose. The site also needed to support a secondary "Notes" section for lightweight snippets and observations.

## Action Taken

Selected Hugo with the Blowfish theme for minimal design and readability. Configured two content types: Work Log (structured entries with mandatory sections) and Notes (short, tagged, searchable). Set date format to YYYY.MMDD. Removed all marketing copy, consultant positioning, and "coming soon" sections. Navigation reduced to four items: Work Log, Notes, About, Archive.

## Outcome / Result

Clean site structure deployed to Cloudflare Pages. Two content types operational with archetypes for consistent entry creation. About page reduced to five lines. No marketing copy, no email capture, no product pages — those wait until real products exist.
