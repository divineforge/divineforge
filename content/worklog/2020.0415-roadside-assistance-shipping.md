## Context

Etiqa, a bank-owned insurance subsidiary, needed a customer-facing roadside assistance application. The app had to handle real-time service requests, provider dispatch, and customer tracking — all within the compliance framework of a financial institution.

## Constraint / Problem

Bank-owned subsidiaries inherit the parent's compliance and security requirements. Every architectural decision required sign-off from both the insurance business unit and the bank's enterprise architecture team. Technology choices were restricted to the approved stack. Third-party integrations needed security assessments that added weeks to each vendor onboarding.

## Action Taken

Built the application on Angular (frontend) and NestJS (backend) with MongoDB as the primary data store. Chose MongoDB specifically for flexible schema design — roadside assistance cases have variable data structures depending on incident type, provider availability, and customer location. Designed the API layer to handle real-time status updates without polling overhead.

## Outcome / Result

Application shipped and went live for Etiqa customers. The flexible schema approach in MongoDB proved correct — new incident types were added post-launch without database migrations. The compliance overhead added to the delivery timeline but the architecture handled the regulatory constraints without rework.
