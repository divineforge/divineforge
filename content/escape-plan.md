# The Escape Plan

## The Problem: Corporate IT Constraints

I'm a software architect at a major financial institution in Malaysia. On paper, it sounds impressive. In reality, I spend my days navigating bureaucracy, sitting through endless meetings, and watching innovative ideas die in committee.

The corporate IT world has a fundamental problem: **organizational constraints kill velocity.**

Every new idea requires:
- 3 layers of approval
- Risk assessments that assume failure
- Technology choices made by people who don't code
- Timelines measured in quarters, not sprints
- Innovation theater instead of actual building

I'm tired of asking permission to build things.

## The Insight: AI Changes Everything

In early 2024, I had a realization: **AI pair programming eliminates the traditional startup bottleneck.**

Previously, building a side business meant:
- Hiring developers (expensive, risky)
- Learning everything yourself (slow, exhausting)
- Choosing between scope and speed (painful tradeoffs)

With Claude Code, Claude, and modern AI tools:
- I can build full-stack products alone
- Velocity is limited by my ideas, not my hands
- Technical debt is manageable
- Quality remains high

**The equation changed: Time + AI = Products**

## The Solution: Build Revenue Streams with AI

My escape plan is simple but specific:

### Target
**$5,000/month in revenue by December 2025**

Why $5K? It's enough to:
- Cover basic living expenses in Malaysia
- Reduce corporate dependence significantly
- Prove the model works
- Create optionality (part-time corporate, more building time)

### Timeline
- **Q4 2024:** Foundation (this site, content engine, first product)
- **Q1 2025:** Scale content, AWS backend, product sales
- **Q2 2025:** Consulting pipeline, second product
- **Q3 2025:** Optimize, automate, compound
- **Q4 2025:** Hit $5K MRR or pivot based on learnings

### Strategy: Multiple Revenue Streams

**1. Digital Products (Primary - 60% of revenue)**
- Corporate Escape Starter Kit: $49
- AWS/Azure Architecture Templates: $29-99
- AI Workflow Bundles: $39
- Target: $3,000/month

**2. Consulting/Fractional Work (High Leverage - 30%)**
- AWS/Azure architecture reviews
- GenAI implementation consulting
- Fractional architect engagements
- Target: $1,500/month

**3. Content/Affiliate (Passive - 10%)**
- Sponsored content (later)
- Tool recommendations
- Course revenue (Q3 2025+)
- Target: $500/month

### Constraints (The Rules)

**Time:**
- Maximum 10 hours/week on side business
- No burnout, sustainable pace only
- Corporate job stays stable until revenue proves itself

**Focus:**
- ONE project at a time
- Ship functional over perfect
- Bias toward revenue-generating activities
- No side quests until foundation is solid

**Tech Stack:**
- Hugo + Cloudflare Pages (frontend)
- AWS Serverless (backend)
- Claude Code (development)
- Obsidian (planning/writing)

## The Narrative: Building in Public

This isn't a stealth startup. **Everything is documented, open, and honest.**

Why build in public?
1. **Accountability** - Public commitment drives action
2. **Audience** - Readers become customers
3. **Learning** - Transparent failures help others
4. **Proof** - Real numbers, real progress, real lessons

### What I'm Sharing

**Weekly:**
- Build logs (technical deep-dives)
- Progress updates (what worked, what didn't)
- Code repositories (open source where possible)

**Monthly:**
- Revenue reports (transparent numbers)
- "Now" page updates (current focus)
- Lessons learned (honest retrospectives)

**The Promise:**
- No fake guru bullshit
- No overnight success stories
- No hiding failures
- Just real building, real numbers, real timeline

## Current Progress

**MRR:** $0 (starting point)
**Email Subscribers:** 0 (just launched)
**Products Shipped:** 0 (in development)
**Articles Published:** 10 (AI + lifestyle content)

**Phase:** Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Current Task:** Site structure + content engine
**Next Milestone:** Newsletter system + AWS backend (Week 3-4)

## Why This Matters

I'm not unique. There are thousands of talented engineers trapped in corporate constraints, dreaming of independence but not knowing where to start.

**This is the playbook:**
- No VC funding needed
- No co-founder required
- No quitting your job prematurely
- Just AI, focus, and consistent shipping

If I can build $5K/month in revenue while working full-time at a bank, anyone can.

**The escape plan isn't about escaping work. It's about escaping constraints.**
