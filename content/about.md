# About DivineForge

## Who I Am

I'm **William Weelau Cheong**, a software architect based in Malaysia, currently working at Maybank (one of Southeast Asia's largest banks). By day, I navigate enterprise IT bureaucracy. By night (and weekends), I'm building my way out of corporate constraints using AI-powered development.

**DivineForge** is my escape vehicle—a platform for building digital products, documenting the journey, and sharing everything I learn along the way.

## The Origin of DivineForge

The name comes from a simple realization:

> **"I found my life in building things, enjoy searching those lego bricks from a pile of loose bricks, aspire to build a tower."**

That's always been my approach to software. I love the craft of assembling systems, finding the right pieces, and building something that works. But in corporate IT, you spend more time in meetings than building.

**DivineForge** represents the forge where I build things on my own terms—with AI as my assistant, constraints as my fuel, and transparency as my commitment.

## What I Do

### Day Job: Enterprise Software Architect
- Architecting cloud solutions (AWS, Azure)
- GenAI implementation and strategy
- Enterprise system design and integration
- Team leadership and technical guidance

**Skills:**
- Cloud Architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Generative AI (LLMs, prompt engineering, AI workflows)
- Backend Development (Go, Python, Node.js)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, SAM, CloudFormation)
- Microservices & Serverless Architecture
- DevOps & CI/CD

### Side Mission: Building Revenue Streams
- Creating digital products (templates, starter kits, tools)
- Writing technical content (AI + development)
- Building in public (transparent progress)
- Helping others escape corporate constraints

**Current Focus:**
- Building $5K/month in revenue by December 2025
- Using AI pair programming (Claude Code) to build solo
- Documenting everything transparently
- Shipping functional products, not perfect ones

## Why I'm Doing This

### The Corporate IT Problem

I'm grateful for my job—it pays well, it's stable, and I work with smart people. But there's a fundamental problem with corporate IT:

**Velocity dies in bureaucracy.**

- Every idea needs 3 layers of approval
- Innovation happens in PowerPoint, not in production
- Technology choices are made by committees, not builders
- Projects are measured in quarters, not sprints
- Risk aversion kills experimentation

I'm not complaining—I understand why large organizations work this way. But I'm also not willing to spend the next 20 years asking permission to build things.

### The AI-Powered Opportunity

AI pair programming changed the equation for solo builders:

**Before AI:**
- Need co-founder or team (coordination overhead)
- Need to choose: scope OR speed (painful tradeoffs)
- Technical debt accumulates fast (solo developers burn out)

**With AI (Claude Code, Claude, etc.):**
- Build full-stack products solo (no coordination needed)
- Velocity is limited by ideas, not hands (AI writes code fast)
- Quality stays high (AI helps with patterns, testing, docs)

**The new equation: Time + AI + Focus = Products**

### The Mission

**Build $5K/month in revenue by December 2025 through digital products.**

Why $5K?
- Covers basic living expenses in Malaysia
- Proves the model works
- Creates optionality (reduce corporate hours, more build time)
- Enables helping others do the same

**The plan is documented at [/escape-plan/](/escape-plan/)**

## What I'm Building

### Current Projects

**1. DivineForge.com (This Site)**
- Building in public platform
- Technical content about AI + development
- Digital product marketplace
- Newsletter and community

**2. Corporate Escape Starter Kit (In Development)**
- AWS infrastructure templates
- AI workflow library
- Side business playbook
- Tech stack decision guides
- **Price:** $49
- **Launch:** Q4 2024 / Q1 2025

**3. AWS Serverless Backend**
- Newsletter subscription system (DIY, no ConvertKit $29/month)
- Contact form automation
- Digital product delivery pipeline
- Built with Lambda + DynamoDB + SES

### Future Projects (Post-Revenue)

**Gzen.io / Gzen.app** - Game development studio
- Philosophical adventure games (Godot + Flutter)
- Launches after DivineForge hits $500/month

**Reyneese.com** - Anonymous creative writing
- WoW adventures + Buddhist wisdom
- Launches after DivineForge hits $1,000/month

**Strategic Focus:** DivineForge gets 100% attention until it generates sustainable revenue. Other projects wait.

## The Tech Stack

**Frontend (This Site):**
- Hugo static site generator (fast, simple, reliable)
- Cloudflare Pages (free hosting, global CDN, auto-deploy)
- PaperMod theme (minimal, responsive, fast)
- Markdown + Git workflow

**Backend (Coming in Phase 2):**
- AWS Lambda (serverless functions)
- API Gateway (HTTP endpoints)
- DynamoDB (data storage)
- SES (email automation)
- S3 (file storage)

**Development Workflow:**
- Obsidian (ideation, planning, drafting)
- Claude Chat (strategy, outlining, refinement)
- Claude Code (implementation, automation)
- Git + GitHub (version control, deployment)

**Why This Stack:**
- Minimal costs ($0-5/month)
- Fast builds and deploys (seconds, not minutes)
- No maintenance overhead (serverless)
- Scales effortlessly (when needed)

## Transparency Commitment

**Everything is documented openly:**

- ✅ Revenue numbers (real MRR, no inflated claims)
- ✅ Email subscriber count (actual growth, not vanity metrics)
- ✅ Product launch results (wins AND failures)
- ✅ Time investment (sustainable 10 hours/week)
- ✅ Code repositories (open source where possible)
- ✅ Lessons learned (honest retrospectives)

**What I won't do:**
- ❌ Fake guru bullshit (no "I made $100K in 30 days" claims)
- ❌ Overnight success stories (this is a marathon)
- ❌ Hidden failures (transparency includes what doesn't work)
- ❌ Expensive courses (focus on products, not selling courses about courses)

**Monthly updates on [/now/](/now/) page.**

## My Philosophy

**On Building:**
- Ship functional over perfect
- Bias toward action over analysis
- Sustainable pace over heroic bursts
- Revenue-generating activities over busywork

**On Learning:**
- Learn in public, fail in public
- Document the journey, not just the wins
- Help others while helping yourself
- Ask for help when stuck

**On AI:**
- AI is a tool, not magic
- Pair programming, not replacement
- Amplifies ability, doesn't replace skill
- Quality still requires human judgment

**On Work:**
- Corporate job is a feature, not a bug (stable income while building)
- Constraints breed creativity (10 hours/week forces focus)
- Optionality is freedom (multiple revenue streams = choice)
- Escape velocity > escape timeline (build sustainably, not recklessly)
