# Tools & Digital Products

Practical tools and templates to help you build products, escape corporate constraints, and create revenue streams with AI assistance.

**Philosophy:** Pay once, use forever. No subscriptions, no upsells, just useful tools at fair prices.

## 🚀 Coming Soon: Corporate Escape Starter Kit

**Price:** $49
**Launch Date:** Q4 2024 / Q1 2025
**Status:** In Development

Everything I'm using to build my way out of corporate IT constraints—infrastructure templates, AI workflows, and a complete playbook for building $5K/month revenue streams while working full-time.

### What's Included

**1. AWS Infrastructure Templates**
- Complete static site setup (Hugo + Cloudflare Pages)
- Newsletter system (Lambda + DynamoDB + SES)
- Contact form automation
- Digital product delivery pipeline
- Serverless API patterns
- Infrastructure as Code (SAM + Terraform examples)
- Cost optimization guide (keep it under $5/month)

**2. AI Workflow Library**
- 50+ Claude Code development patterns
- Content generation prompts (articles, products, marketing)
- Product ideation frameworks
- Automation workflows (content → code → deployment)
- Prompt engineering templates
- AI pair programming best practices

**3. Side Business Playbook**
- Time management strategies (5-10 hours/week)
- Revenue validation checklist (avoid building wrong things)
- MVP scoping templates (ship fast, iterate based on feedback)
- Launch timeline (8-week path to first dollar)
- Transparent case studies (what worked, what didn't)
- Building in public guide

**4. Tech Stack Decision Matrix**
- Free vs. paid tools comparison
- DIY vs. buy decision framework

- **Lifetime updates** as I improve the systems
- **Email support** for setup questions

### Why Buy This?

**Saves You:**
- 40+ hours of AWS setup trial-and-error
- $200+ in ConvertKit/Mailchimp subscriptions (first year)
- Weeks of researching "what works" vs. "what doesn't"
- The paralysis of "where do I even start?"

**Gets You:**
- Working infrastructure in 1-2 days
- Proven AI workflows that actually ship products
- A realistic timeline (not "get rich quick")
- Honest numbers and expectations

**Not For You If:**
- You want passive income without building
- You're looking for overnight success stories
- You expect someone else to do the work
- You want a "course" with 50 hours of videos

**Perfect For You If:**
- You're a developer/architect escaping corporate constraints
- You have 5-10 hours/week to build
- You want to use AI to amplify your ability
- You prefer doing over learning theory
- You value transparency over hype

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why should I trust you? You haven't made money yet.**
A: Exactly. I'm documenting the journey from $0 to $5K/month. You're getting the real process, not a highlight reel. The templates are what I'm actually using to build my escape.

**Q: Is this another "make money online" course?**
A: No. This is infrastructure and workflows for people who already know how to build software. No "passive income" promises, no affiliate marketing schemes, just real tools for real builders.

**Q: What if I don't use AWS?**
A: The AWS templates are specific, but the AI workflows and playbook are cloud-agnostic. You'll still get 70% of the value. That said, AWS is recommended for serverless simplicity and cost.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**
A: Yes. If you genuinely try the templates and they don't work for you, email within 30 days for a full refund. No questions asked.

**Q: Will you provide support?**
A: Email support for setup questions, yes. But this is DIY—I'm not a customer service team. The documentation is comprehensive. If you need hand-holding, this isn't for you.

**Q: How is this different from free tutorials online?**
A: Free tutorials are scattered, incomplete, and generic. This is a complete, opinionated system that actually works together. It's the difference between a recipe collection and a tested meal plan.
