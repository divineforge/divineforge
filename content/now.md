# What I'm Building Now

**Primary Focus:** DivineForge Site Foundation + Content Engine

I'm in Phase 1 of the escape plan: establishing the foundation for building revenue streams with AI assistance. This means getting the website structure right, setting up content pipelines, and preparing for the AWS backend integration that will power newsletters and digital product delivery.

## Active Projects

### 1. DivineForge.com Transformation
**Status:** In Progress (Phase 1, Week 1)
**Goal:** Transform from portfolio site to "building in public" platform

**Recent Progress:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive development plan (PLANS.md)
- ✅ Audited Hugo PaperMod theme (keeping it)
- 🔄 Building new site structure (escape-plan, now, builds, tools, about)
- ⏳ Next: Update navigation, write origin story content

### 2. AWS Serverless Backend
**Status:** Planned (Phase 2, Week 3-4)
**Goal:** Newsletter subscription + contact form infrastructure

**What's Coming:**
- Lambda functions for form handling
- DynamoDB for subscriber data
- SES for email automation (no $29/month ConvertKit)
- API Gateway endpoints
- Zero to minimal monthly costs

### 3. First Digital Product: Corporate Escape Starter Kit
**Status:** Concept/Planning (Phase 4, Week 7-8)
**Target Price:** $49
**Goal:** First dollar earned, validate the model

**What It Includes:**
- AWS infrastructure templates (Terraform/SAM)
- AI workflow library (Claude prompts, patterns)
- Side business playbook (time management, validation)
- Tech stack decision matrix

## Learning

**Current Focus:**
- AWS SAM vs. Terraform for serverless (leaning SAM for simplicity)
- Building in public best practices (studying IndieHackers, @levelsio)
- Content repurposing strategies (article → thread → video → newsletter)

**Reading:**
- "The Mom Test" by Rob Fitzpatrick (customer validation)
- AWS Serverless docs (backend prep)
- IndieHackers case studies (learning from others)

## Experiments

**Content Format Testing:**
- Long-form technical articles (current)
- Build logs with code snippets (coming soon)
- Video walkthroughs (considering for Q1 2025)
- Newsletter format (testing in Phase 2)

**AI Workflow Optimization:**
- Obsidian → Claude Chat → Claude Code pipeline
- Automated content scaffolding
- Code generation patterns

## Stats

**Revenue (MRR):** $0
**Email Subscribers:** 0 (launching in Phase 2)
**Content Published:** 10 articles (AI + lifestyle)
**GitHub Repos:** Private (will open source selected projects)
**Time Investment:** ~8 hours/week (sustainable pace)

## What I'm NOT Doing

**Staying Focused:**
- ❌ Not building SaaS (too complex, too slow to revenue)
- ❌ Not doing freelance/Upwork (time-for-money trap)
- ❌ Not starting Gzen.io game studio yet (waits until $500/month)
- ❌ Not starting Reyneese.com writing yet (waits until $1K/month)
- ❌ Not over-engineering (ship functional, iterate)

**The Rule:** DivineForge gets 100% focus until it generates sustainable revenue.

## Next 30 Days

**November 2024:**
- ✅ Complete site restructure (this page, escape-plan, builds, tools, about)
- 🔄 Deploy updated site to Cloudflare Pages
- ⏳ Write 2-4 technical articles (building with Claude Code series)
- ⏳ Set up AWS backend (newsletter + contact form)
- ⏳ Launch email list with first 10-20 subscribers

**December 2024:**
- Start "Corporate Escape Starter Kit" product development
- Publish 4 technical articles
- Grow email list to 50+ subscribers
- Share progress on Twitter/LinkedIn/IndieHackers
- First revenue goal: $50-100 (validation)
