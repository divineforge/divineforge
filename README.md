# Divineforge
Visit [divineforge.com](https://divineforge.com) My online portfolio and blog, built with Hugo and PaperMod theme.
I'm grateful of the abundance of resources available online that helped me create this site;
including the OpenSource Community, and nowadays technologies that made things more accessible.
Hoping to be able to give back to the community in the future.

## Dev Logs
